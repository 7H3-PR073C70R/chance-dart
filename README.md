Chance - Random generator helper for Dart

Homepage: [https://github.com/Yczar/chance-dart](https://github.com/Yczar/chance-dart)

Many more details on [https://github.com/Yczar/chance-dart](https://github.com/Yczar/chance-dart) but this single
library can generate random numbers, characters, strings, names, addresses,
dice, and pretty much anything else.

It includes the basic building blocks for all these items and is built on top
of a Mersenne Twister so it can generate these things with repeatability, if
desired.

## Usage

See the [full docs](https://github.com/Yczar/chance-dart) for details on installation and usage.

## Dependent tools

- [Chance Dart CLI](https://github.com/chancejs/chance-cli) - Use Chance on the command line.

_Know a library that uses Chance that isn't here? Update the README and submit a PR!_
